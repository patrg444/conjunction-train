# WAV2VEC Data Verification Results

## Summary of Findings

Direct examination of the WAV2VEC feature files on the EC2 server revealed:

1. There are exactly **8,690 WAV2VEC feature files** in the primary directory:
   - `/home/ubuntu/audio_emotion/models/wav2vec`
   
2. File structure details:
   - All files use the key: `wav2vec_features` (not `embeddings`)
   - Additional keys: `label`, `emotion`, `emotion_class`
   - Feature dimension: 768 (standard WAV2VEC embedding size)
   - Example files: `cremad_1001_DFA_ANG_XX.npz`, `cremad_1001_DFA_DIS_XX.npz`, etc.

3. Cross-validation performance from these files:
   - Overall accuracy: 19.79%
   - Balanced accuracy: 15.04%
   - F1 score: 13.55%

## Problem Identification

The key issue we identified was that our initial evaluation script was looking for features under the key name `embeddings`, but the actual data files stored the features under the key name `wav2vec_features`.

This explains the errors seen in the original run:
```
Error loading file: 'embeddings is not a file in the archive'
```

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Data Format Detection**: Modified the evaluation script to handle both key naming conventions:
   ```python
   if 'wav2vec_features' in data:
       embedding = data['wav2vec_features']
   elif 'embeddings' in data:
       embedding = data['embeddings']
   ```

2. **Cross-Validation Script**: Created a cross-validation deployment script that uses the fixed evaluation approach.

3. **Data Verification**: Developed a utility script to verify the WAV2VEC data structure across the server, confirming our findings.

## Key Files Created

1. `evaluate_wav2vec_full_dataset_fixed.py`: Fixed evaluation script that handles both key naming conventions
2. `deploy_cross_validation_fixed.sh`: Script to deploy and run cross-validation using the fixed evaluation script
3. `find_wav2vec_features.sh`: Comprehensive search utility for WAV2VEC feature files

## Path Forward

1. The current performance metrics (19.79% accuracy) suggest potential for improvement. We should consider:
   - Using more sophisticated model architectures (e.g., attention mechanisms)
   - Extending training beyond the 10 epochs used in cross-validation
   - Exploring data augmentation techniques

2. Data consistency:
   - Consider standardizing the feature naming conventions across the pipeline
   - Document these conventions to avoid similar issues in the future
