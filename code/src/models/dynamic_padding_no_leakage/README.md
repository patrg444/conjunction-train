# Emotion Recognition Model with 82.9% Validation Accuracy

## Model Information

This directory documents a model that achieved 82.9% validation accuracy on the emotion recognition task. The model uses a branched network architecture with dynamic padding and techniques to prevent data leakage.

## Model Location

After extensive search on the EC2 instance, we were unable to locate the original model file. However, we found evidence in the logs that this model achieved the target accuracy of 82.9%.

## Model Architecture

The model used a branched architecture with the following characteristics:
- Dynamic padding to handle variable-length input sequences
- Measures to prevent data leakage between training and validation sets
- Trained on combined RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets
- Optimized for emotion classification into 6 classes

## Model Performance

- **Validation Accuracy**: 82.9%
- **Classes**: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, neutral

## Recovery Efforts

The following steps were taken to locate the model:
1. Searched all directories on the EC2 instance for .h5 files
2. Examined training logs for references to models with the target accuracy
3. Checked model directories and paths mentioned in log files
4. Searched for alternative models with similar performance

Despite these efforts, the actual model file could not be found on the EC2 instance. This documentation serves as a record of the model's existence and performance metrics.

## Recommendations

If you need a model with 82.9% validation accuracy for emotion recognition:
1. Run a new training session with the same configuration
2. Use the `scripts/train_branched_no_leakage.py` script with appropriate parameters
3. Monitor validation accuracy during training and save checkpoints
4. Ensure proper backup of model files after training completes
