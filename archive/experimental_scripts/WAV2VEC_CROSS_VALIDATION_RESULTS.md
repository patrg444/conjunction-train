# WAV2VEC Model Cross-Validation Results

## Issue Identification and Resolution

We encountered an issue when attempting to run cross-validation on the WAV2VEC emotion recognition model. The initial script was failing because it was looking for features under the key name `embeddings`, but the actual data files stored the features under the key name `wav2vec_features`.

### Diagnosis Steps

1. Created a data verification script to examine the NPZ file structure
2. Found that all 96 feature files contained the features under the `wav2vec_features` key (not `embeddings`)
3. Modified the evaluation script to handle both key names for maximum flexibility

### Resolution

We successfully:
- Fixed the script to check for features under both `embeddings` and `wav2vec_features` keys
- Updated the SSH/SCP commands to use the correct key file for authentication 
- Completed a full 5-fold cross-validation on the dataset
- Downloaded the results including confusion matrix visualization

## Cross-Validation Results

### Overall Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 19.79% |
| Balanced Accuracy | 15.04% |
| F1 Score | 13.55% |

### Performance by Fold

| Fold | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 25.00% | 10.00% |
| 2 | 15.79% | 7.52% |
| 3 | 21.05% | 8.02% |
| 4 | 15.79% | 6.02% |
| 5 | 21.05% | 13.16% |

## Analysis and Recommendations

The cross-validation results indicate relatively low performance on the emotion recognition task. This may be due to several factors:

1. **Model Architecture**: The simple LSTM architecture used for cross-validation might not be capturing the complex patterns needed for emotion recognition. 
   - **Recommendation**: Experiment with more sophisticated architectures like attention mechanisms, transformer encoders, or convolutional-recurrent hybrids.

2. **Training Process**: The limited training (only 10 epochs) may not be sufficient for the model to learn effectively.
   - **Recommendation**: Increase training time, use learning rate scheduling, and implement early stopping with a more patient approach.

3. **Feature Quality**: The WAV2VEC features may need additional processing or normalization.
   - **Recommendation**: Apply feature normalization, augmentation techniques, or consider using different audio feature extraction methods.

4. **Class Imbalance**: The difference between accuracy and balanced accuracy suggests class imbalance issues.
   - **Recommendation**: Use class weights, oversampling, or augmentation to address imbalance in the dataset.

5. **Feature Naming Consistency**: Ensure consistent naming conventions across the pipeline to avoid similar issues in the future.
   - **Recommendation**: Document the expected data structure and add validation checks in preprocessing scripts.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the improved model architecture based on the `fixed_v9_attention.py` script which includes attention mechanisms
2. Run a longer training process with proper learning rate scheduling
3. Apply data augmentation to address class imbalance
4. Consider ensemble methods to improve generalization
5. Standardize the feature naming conventions across the pipeline
