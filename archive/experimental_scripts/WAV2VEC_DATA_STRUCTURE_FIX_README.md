# Wav2Vec Emotion Recognition - Data Structure Fix

This document summarizes the solution developed to fix the wav2vec emotion recognition model training that was failing with "No valid files found".

## Problem Identification

The issue was identified through diagnostic scripts showing a mismatch between expected and actual data structures:

1. **Original expectation**: Data in subdirectories by emotion label
   - Expected path: `/home/ubuntu/audio_emotion/wav2vec_features/[emotion_name]/file.npz`

2. **Actual structure**: All files in a flat directory with emotional labels encoded in filenames
   - Actual path: `/home/ubuntu/audio_emotion/models/wav2vec/[filename_with_emotion_code].npz`
   - Where the emotion code is embedded in the filename (not in the directory path)

## Solution Implementation

The solution was implemented in three parts:

### 1. Diagnostic Script

Created `scripts/check_wav2vec_data_directory.py` to:
- Scan for NPZ files in various possible locations
- Analyze filename patterns
- Identify potential emotion labels in filenames
- Check for required normalization statistics files

### 2. Fixed Training Script

Created `scripts/train_wav2vec_audio_only_fixed_v3.py` with key improvements:

- **Filename-based Emotion Extraction**:
  - RAVDESS pattern: `ravdess_01-01-05-...` (3rd token is emotion code)
  - CREMA-D pattern: `cremad_1025_TSI_HAP_XX.npz` (4th token is emotion code)

- **Improved Error Handling**:
  - Better handling of NPZ file formats (supports various key names)
  - Computation of normalization statistics when not found
  - NaN/Inf detection and prevention

- **Enhanced Numerical Stability**:
  - Safe normalization with epsilon values
  - Gradient clipping for training stability
  - Proper reshaping of 1D arrays when needed

### 3. Deployment & Monitoring Scripts

- `deploy_fixed_wav2vec_training_v3.sh`: Deploys script and launches training on EC2
- `monitor_wav2vec_fixed_training_v3.sh`: Advanced monitoring with GPU stats and log analysis
- `download_wav2vec_fixed_model_v3.sh`: Downloads models, statistics, and logs after training

## Usage

1. **Deploy and start training**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_fixed_wav2vec_training_v3.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor training progress**:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_wav2vec_fixed_training_v3.sh
   ```

3. **Download trained model**:
   ```bash
   ./download_wav2vec_fixed_model_v3.sh
   ```

## Technical Details

### Emotion Label Mapping

The script supports the following emotion mappings from filenames:

- **RAVDESS Numeric Codes**:
  - 01: neutral
  - 02: calm
  - 03: happy
  - 04: sad
  - 05: angry
  - 06: fear
  - 07: disgust
  - 08: surprise

- **CREMA-D Alpha Codes**:
  - NEU: neutral
  - HAP: happy
  - SAD: sad
  - ANG: angry
  - FEA: fear
  - DIS: disgust

### NPZ File Handling

The script supports various NPZ structure patterns:
1. Files with 'emb' key
2. Files with 'embedding' key
3. Files with 'features' key
4. Files with 'wav2vec' key
5. Or using the first array if no known keys match

### Normalization Statistics

Normalization statistics are either:
1. Loaded from `wav2vec_mean.npy` and `wav2vec_std.npy` if they exist
2. Computed from the data and saved for future use if they don't exist

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for additional filename patterns if needed
2. Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
3. Add mixed precision training for faster execution
4. Integrate with the multi-modal fusion pipeline

This solution achieves the goal of successfully training the emotion recognition model using wav2vec features with the existing data structure, without requiring reorganization of files.
