# G5 CNN Feature Extraction Fix

## Problem Summary
The CNN audio feature extraction process was failing on the G5 instance due to CUDA initialization errors. This prevented the pre-processing step needed for training the emotion recognition model.

## Solution Implemented
We've successfully implemented a fix that forces the feature extraction to run in CPU-only mode, bypassing the GPU initialization issues. This allows the extraction to proceed, albeit at a slower pace than if GPU acceleration were functioning properly.

## Implementation Details

### Diagnosis
1. We identified the root cause to be CUDA initialization errors in TensorFlow when attempting to use the GPU for feature extraction
2. The error pattern showed multiple failed attempts: `CUDA error: Failed setting context: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error`
3. The process was consistently crashing rather than falling back to CPU-only mode automatically

### Fix
1. We launched the feature extraction with an explicit CPU-only environment variable:
   ```bash
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 python3 -u scripts/preprocess_cnn_audio_features.py
   ```
2. This forces TensorFlow to use only CPU processing and avoid any GPU initialization attempts
3. We verified the process is running with 4 worker processes for multi-core CPU utilization

### Monitoring
We created a dedicated monitoring script to track extraction progress:
```bash
./monitor_cnn_feature_extraction.sh
```

This script provides:
- Verification that extraction processes are running
- Count of extracted feature files for each dataset
- Progress percentage for overall extraction
- Estimated completion time (once processing has started)

## Expected Timeline
- The extraction process needs to process 8,882 spectrogram files (1,440 from RAVDESS and 7,442 from CREMA-D)
- Using CPU-only mode, this will take approximately 1-2 hours
- Once extraction is complete, we can proceed with model training using:
  ```bash
  ./run_audio_pooling_with_laughter.sh
  ```

## Future Improvements
For a more permanent solution, the feature extraction code should be modified to:
1. Add explicit error handling for GPU initialization failures
2. Implement an automatic fallback to CPU processing
3. Add clear logging of processing mode (GPU vs CPU)

## Training After Extraction
Once the CNN audio features are extracted, we will restart the training process with:
```bash
./run_audio_pooling_with_laughter.sh
```

The model training itself should use the GPU correctly, as it uses a different initialization path than the feature extraction process.
