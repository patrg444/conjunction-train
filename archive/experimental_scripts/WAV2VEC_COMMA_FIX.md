# Wav2Vec Emotion Recognition Learning Rate Fix

## Issue Summary

The Wav2Vec emotion recognition model training was failing due to a syntax error in the learning rate scheduler callback. The error occurred during the `on_epoch_begin` method of the `WarmUpReduceLROnPlateau` callback class.

**Error message:**
```
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by a missing comma in the function call to `set_value()`. Specifically, in two locations:

1. In the `on_epoch_begin` method:
```python
# Missing comma between arguments
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate warmup_lr)
```

2. In the `on_epoch_end` method:
```python
# Missing comma between arguments
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate new_lr)
```

Without the comma, Python interpreted `self.model.optimizer.learning_rate warmup_lr` as a syntax error, but at runtime, it tried to evaluate `warmup_lr` as an attribute of `learning_rate`, resulting in the specific error message.

## Verification Process

We verified the issue with the following steps:

1. Created a local test script (`local_test_wav2vec.py`) to confirm the correct comma placement
2. Tested the local script with a sample of the dataset
3. Confirmed the script executed without the `'str' object has no attribute 'name'` error

## Solution

We implemented multiple approaches to fix the issue:

### 1. Local Test Script

Created a local test version with the proper comma placement:

```python
# Fixed version with comma
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate, warmup_lr)
```

### 2. Server-Side Fix

Used direct server editing to add the missing commas in the production script:

```python
# From:
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate warmup_lr)
# To:
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate, warmup_lr)

# From:
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate new_lr)
# To:
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate, new_lr)
```

### 3. Automated Fix Script

Created `fix_server_script.py` to programmatically:
- Download the script from the server
- Fix the comma issue
- Upload the corrected script
- Restart the training process

## Results

After applying the fix, the Wav2Vec model training successfully proceeded past the error point. The learning rate scheduler now functions correctly, properly adjusting the learning rate during training based on validation loss.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Syntax Verification**: Even minor syntax issues like missing commas can cause non-obvious runtime errors
2. **Staged Testing**: Testing fixes locally before deploying to production helps identify issues early
3. **Error Message Interpretation**: The error message "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'" was actually caused by a syntax error, highlighting the importance of looking beyond the immediate error message
4. **Direct Server Editing**: Sometimes direct server-side fixes are the most efficient way to address urgent issues

## Future Recommendations

1. Add syntax linting as part of the deployment process
2. Implement unit tests for critical components like the learning rate scheduler
3. Consider adding type annotations to catch similar errors during development
