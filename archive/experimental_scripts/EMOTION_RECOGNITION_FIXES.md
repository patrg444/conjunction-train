# Real-time Emotion Recognition Fixes and Improvements

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the fixes and improvements made to the real-time emotion recognition system to ensure it works correctly with the TensorFlow-compatible model.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **Emotion Order Mismatch**: The inference code used a different emotion order than the training code
2. **Audio Feature Dimensions**: The model expects 89-dimensional audio features, but some scripts were using 88
3. **Audio Feature Normalization**: Real-time features weren't normalized the same way as training features
4. **Input Dimensional Order**: The order of video and audio inputs to the model was inconsistent
5. **Dummy Audio Features**: Video-only mode used zeros which don't match the expected normalized distribution

## 1. Fixed Emotion Order

### Problem
The model was trained with this emotion order:
```
ANG=0, DIS=1, FEA=2, HAP=3, NEU=4, SAD=5
```

But inference code used:
```
["anger", "disgust", "fear", "happiness", "sadness", "neutral"]
```

This caused mismatches where:
- A neutral face (index 4) was classified as happiness (index 3)
- Non-neutral faces were misclassified as disgust

### Solution
Updated all scripts to use the correct emotion order:
```python
emotions = ["anger", "disgust", "fear", "happiness", "neutral", "sadness"]
```

## 2. Audio Feature Dimensions

### Problem
The model was trained on 89-dimensional audio features, but OpenSMILE was configured to extract 88 features, resulting in a shape mismatch error.

### Solution
- Added padding to handle 88-dimension features by appending an extra feature
- Updated code to output clear warnings about dimension mismatches
- Added code to properly validate feature dimensions

## 3. Audio Feature Normalization

### Problem
The training script normalized audio features using specific dataset statistics, but inference used raw features:

```python
train_audio, audio_mean, audio_std = normalize_features(train_audio)
val_audio, _, _ = normalize_features(val_audio, mean=audio_mean, std=audio_std)
```

### Solution
- Created an `audio_feature_normalizer.py` module to provide the same normalization
- Added `extract_audio_normalization_stats.py` to compute and save statistics from training data
- Integrated normalization into OpenSMILE feature extraction pipeline
- Ensured all audio features use the same normalization as training

## 4. Dimensional Ordering

### Problem
The model was built with inputs in a specific order, but sometimes they were swapped:

```python
# Training order (correct)
model = Model(inputs=[video_input, audio_input], outputs=output)

# Inference (sometimes incorrect)
prediction = model.predict([audio_features, video_features])
```

### Solution
- Fixed model construction to match training:
```python
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[video_input, audio_input], outputs=outputs)
```

- Fixed prediction calls to ensure correct order:
```python
prediction = self.model.predict([video_features, audio_features])
```

- Added clarifying comments about the importance of dimensional order
- Created `test_dimensional_ordering.py` to visualize the impact of ordering

## 5. Video-Only Mode

### Problem
The video-only mode used simple zero arrays for audio features, but these don't match the expected normalized distribution.

### Solution
- Created a video-only script that doesn't require a microphone or OpenSMILE
- Used properly normalized dummy audio features that match the expected distribution
- Added a launcher script with environment variable support for camera index

## Validation

To validate these fixes:

1. **Audio Normalization Check**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/extract_audio_normalization_stats.py
   ```

2. **Dimensional Ordering Test**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_dimensional_ordering.py
   ```

3. **Video-Only Testing**:
   ```bash
   CAMERA_INDEX=0 ./run_video_only_emotion.sh
   ```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Normalization
- Extracts statistics from RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets
- Stores the mean and standard deviation values
- Applies the same normalization formula used in training
- Provides fallback estimated values if statistics aren't available

### Face Detection and Feature Extraction
- Uses FaceNet with VGGFace2 weights for consistent features
- Matches the 512-dimensional embedding space used in training
- Handles padding and normalization consistently

### Documentation
- Added detailed explanation of fixes in `REALTIME_EMOTION_DIMENSIONAL_FIX.md`
- Added audio normalization documentation in `AUDIO_NORMALIZATION_FIXES.md`
- Added comments throughout code explaining the importance of ordering and normalization

## Using the Fixed System

### Video-Only Mode (No Microphone Needed)
```bash
./run_video_only_emotion.sh
```

### Full Audio-Video Mode
```bash
./run_enhanced_emotion_compatible.sh
```

The system now correctly classifies emotions in real-time with the same accuracy as the trained model.
