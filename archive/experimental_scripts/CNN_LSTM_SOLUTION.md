# CNN-LSTM Model for Emotion Recognition - Solution

## Problem Summary

The original CNN-LSTM model using attention had multiple issues:
1. Syntax errors with missing commas in the train script
2. Dimension mismatch issues with the Attention layer
3. Variable sequence lengths causing shape inconsistencies in batches
4. Training instability due to these architecture issues

## Solution Implemented

We developed a simplified CNN-LSTM model that:

1. **Fixed Sequence Length**: Enforced a consistent MAX_SEQ_LENGTH (20) for all batches through padding/truncation
2. **Removed Problematic Attention Layer**: Replaced with GlobalAveragePooling1D for stable time dimension collapse
3. **Enhanced Padding Handling**: Added proper masking support to handle padded sequences
4. **Improved Regularization**: Added stronger L2 regularization (0.001) and higher dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting
5. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Used a lower initial learning rate (0.0003) with reduction on plateau
6. **Stratified Data Split**: Ensured balanced class distribution in train/validation splits
7. **Class Weighting**: Added support for handling class imbalance

## Implementation Details

1. Developed a robust `pad_or_truncate` function to ensure consistent sequence lengths
2. Created a `FeatureNormalizer` class to standardize audio features
3. Used bidirectional LSTM layers with proper recurrent regularization
4. Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting
5. Added comprehensive dataset loading with proper validation and error handling

## Verification & Testing

1. Created `test_simplified_model.py` to verify:
   - Model architecture soundness
   - Variable length sequence handling
   - Forward and backward pass execution
   - Shape consistency across all operations

2. The simplified model passed all local tests with:
   - Successfully handled sequences of different lengths
   - Proper feature normalization
   - Stable gradient flow during training steps

## Deployment

The model has been successfully deployed to EC2 and is currently training with:

1. Automatic feature normalization
2. Class weighting for imbalanced data
3. Comprehensive logging and checkpoint saving
4. Model performance monitoring

## Monitoring Training

To monitor the training progress:
```bash
./monitor_simplified_cnn_lstm_20250423_115239.sh
```

Or directly with:
```bash
ssh -i "/Users/patrickgloria/Downloads/gpu-key.pem" ubuntu@54.162.134.77 "tail -f /home/ubuntu/emotion_project/simplified_cnn_lstm_training_20250423_115239.log"
```

## Using the Trained Model

Once training completes, the best model will be saved to:
```
/home/ubuntu/emotion_project/checkpoints/
```

To download the best model for inference:
```bash
scp -i "/Users/patrickgloria/Downloads/gpu-key.pem" \
  ubuntu@54.162.134.77:/home/ubuntu/emotion_project/checkpoints/cnn_lstm_simplified_*.h5 ./
```

## Key Improvements

- **Stability**: Model handles variable-length sequences without dimension errors
- **Simplicity**: Architecture is more straightforward and maintainable
- **Performance**: Enhanced regularization should lead to better generalization
- **Scalability**: Fixed sequence length enables batch processing optimization
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent training results with fixed random seeds
