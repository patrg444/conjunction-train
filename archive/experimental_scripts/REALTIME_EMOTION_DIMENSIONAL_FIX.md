# Real-time Emotion Recognition Dimensional Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the dimensional ordering issue in the real-time emotion recognition pipeline, ensuring full compatibility with the model trained with `train_branched_no_leakage.py`.

## Problem Overview

The original model was trained with inputs in a specific order:
1. Video features (512 dimensions from FaceNet)
2. Audio features (88 dimensions from OpenSMILE)

However, there was an inconsistency in the real-time inference code that could lead to swapped dimensions, resulting in incorrect emotion predictions.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed TensorFlow Compatible Model

In `scripts/tensorflow_compatible_model.py`:

- Updated model construction to match the training script's order:
  ```python
  # Original (potentially inconsistent)
  model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[audio_input, video_input], outputs=outputs)
  
  # Fixed (matches training script)
  model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[video_input, audio_input], outputs=outputs)
  ```

- Fixed the predict method to ensure correct dimensional ordering:
  ```python
  # Original (mismatch between parameter order and actual usage)
  def predict(self, video_features, audio_features):
      # ...
      prediction = self.model.predict([audio_features, video_features], verbose=0)
  
  # Fixed (consistent ordering)
  def predict(self, video_features, audio_features):
      # ...
      prediction = self.model.predict([video_features, audio_features], verbose=0)
  ```

### 2. Updated Real-time Scripts

In both `scripts/compatible_realtime_emotion.py` and `scripts/enhanced_compatible_realtime_emotion.py`:

- Added clarifying comments to emphasize the correct ordering:
  ```python
  # Make prediction - ensuring correct order (video, audio) as in training
  prediction = self.model.predict(video_features, audio_features)
  ```

### 3. Added Enhanced Launcher Script

Created `run_enhanced_emotion_compatible.sh`:

- Uses the enhanced version of the real-time script with proper feature extraction
- Clearly communicates in the terminal that it ensures correct dimensional ordering
- Automatically detects OpenSMILE and its configuration
- Provides more information about what's happening under the hood

## Feature Processing

The enhanced system now uses:

1. **Video Features**: 
   - FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1 with VGGFace2 weights)
   - 512-dimensional facial embeddings
   - Exactly the same as the features used in training datasets (ravdess_features_facenet)

2. **Audio Features**: 
   - OpenSMILE with eGeMAPSv02 configuration
   - 88-dimensional audio features
   - Matching the features used in training

## How to Run

Execute the enhanced script:

```bash
./run_enhanced_emotion_compatible.sh
```

This will:
1. Find all necessary components (Python, OpenSMILE, model)
2. Launch the application with corrected dimensional ordering
3. Provide real-time emotion recognition with proper input processing

## Technical Details

- The model expects input shape: `[video_features (batch, sequence, 512), audio_features (batch, sequence, 88)]`
- FaceNet features are already normalized during extraction
- OpenSMILE features are processed to match training data specifications
- Dynamic padding is properly handled in the model architecture
- Enhanced version includes automatic audio device selection and better error handling

## Verification

When running the fixed version, you should observe:
- Smoother emotion predictions
- Better accuracy for combined audio+video emotion detection
- Proper recognition of all 6 emotion classes (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, neutral)
