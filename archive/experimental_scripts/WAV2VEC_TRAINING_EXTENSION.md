# Wav2Vec Audio Emotion Recognition Training Extension

## Overview

This document describes the extension of the wav2vec audio emotion recognition training beyond the fixed version. After successfully fixing the ResourceVariable issue, we've verified that training is using the complete dataset and have set up an extended training procedure to potentially improve the model's performance.

## Current Status

### Dataset Verification

We've confirmed that the training is using the full dataset available:

- Total feature files available: 8,692 (.npz and .npy files)
- Files being used in training: 8,690 (99.98% utilization)
- Only 2 files excluded due to validation/parsing issues

The data is properly distributed with:
- Training set: 7,821 samples (90%)
- Validation set: 869 samples (10%)

All 7 emotion classes are represented with proper distribution:
- Neutral: 1,065 samples
- Calm: 173 samples
- Happy: 1,317 samples
- Sad: 1,317 samples
- Angry: 1,316 samples
- Fear: 1,316 samples
- Disgust: 1,317 samples

### Current Performance

The fixed training has reached 100 epochs with the following results:

- Best validation accuracy: 54.43%
- Training appears to have plateaued in the later epochs
- The model is performing without any ResourceVariable or numerical stability errors

## Extended Training

To potentially improve model performance, we've implemented an extended training approach that continues from the best checkpoint with the following enhancements:

1. **Lower learning rate** (0.0005 instead of 0.001) to make finer adjustments
2. **Additional epochs** (100 more) to see if the model can break through the current plateau
3. **Shorter warm-up** period for continued training
4. **Same model architecture** to ensure compatibility with previous weights

## Scripts Guide

### 1. Extended Training Script

`train_wav2vec_extended_epochs.py`: Main Python script for continuing training from the best checkpoint. Key features:
- Loads the existing model weights
- Continues training with modified hyperparameters
- Preserves the custom layers and model architecture
- Includes comprehensive monitoring and checkpointing

### 2. Deployment Script

`deploy_extended_wav2vec_training.sh`: Deploys and launches the extended training on the EC2 instance:
```bash
./deploy_extended_wav2vec_training.sh
```

This script:
- Copies the extended training script to the EC2 instance
- Starts training from the best weights file of the previous run
- Configures 100 additional epochs with reduced learning rate
- Runs the training in the background with nohup

### 3. Monitoring Script

`monitor_extended_wav2vec_training.sh`: Monitors the progress of the extended training:
```bash
./monitor_extended_wav2vec_training.sh
```

This script:
- Finds the most recent extended training log file
- Checks if the training process is still running
- Shows the latest log entries
- Displays recent validation accuracy
- Shows the highest validation accuracy achieved so far

### 4. Download Script

`download_extended_wav2vec_model.sh`: Downloads the best model after extended training:
```bash
./download_extended_wav2vec_model.sh
```

This script:
- Finds the latest extended model checkpoint
- Downloads the model weights
- Downloads associated validation files
- Displays the validation accuracy

## Expected Outcomes

The extended training may result in one of these outcomes:

1. **Further improvement**: The model may break through the plateau with more epochs at a lower learning rate, resulting in validation accuracy above 54.43%.

2. **Confirmation of convergence**: If accuracy doesn't improve further, this confirms that the model has converged at its optimal point.

3. **Potential overfitting**: If training accuracy continues to rise but validation accuracy drops, this indicates overfitting, suggesting that the previous checkpoint represents the best generalization point.

## Using the Final Model

Once the extended training completes, the best model weights will be saved to:
`/home/ubuntu/audio_emotion/checkpoints/wav2vec_continued_extended_*_best.weights.h5`

After downloading with the provided script, you can use this model for:
1. Inference on new audio samples
2. Deployment in a real-time emotion recognition system
3. Transfer learning to related audio classification tasks
4. Integration with other modalities (like video) for multimodal emotion recognition

## Future Work Considerations

1. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Further improvements might be possible with a comprehensive hyperparameter search.
2. **Alternative architectures**: Trying different model architectures such as Transformer-based models.
3. **Data augmentation**: Implementing audio-specific augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
4. **Transfer learning**: Fine-tuning from other pre-trained audio models beyond wav2vec.
