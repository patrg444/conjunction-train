# Facenet Video-Only Model Fix Summary

## Problem

The Facenet video-only training pipeline was failing with the following error:

```
Found 0 Facenet files with valid labels and features.
Skipped 7441 due to label parsing or feature issues.

Train/Val split (Full):
- Train samples: 0
- Validation samples: 0

[...]

ValueError: The PyDataset has length 0
```

## Root Causes

After investigating, we identified two key issues:

1. **Missing `allow_pickle=True` Parameter**: The NPZ files contained object arrays (for emotion labels) that require the `allow_pickle=True` flag when loading with NumPy. Without this flag, the loading process fails, leading to all files being skipped.

2. **Generator Incompatibility**: The code was trying to use the `SpectrogramCnnPoolingGenerator` in video-only mode, but this generator was not properly designed for video-only operation.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed NPZ Loading**: Added `allow_pickle=True` parameter to all `np.load()` calls in the training script to properly load the emotion labels.

2. **Created Specialized Generator**: Implemented a new `VideoOnlyFacenetGenerator` class specifically designed for handling video-only features without requiring audio inputs.

3. **Updated Training Script**: Modified the training script to use the new video-only generator instead of adapting the spectrogram-based generator.

## Files Modified/Created

1. `scripts/train_video_only_facenet_lstm_key_fixed.py`: Updated to properly load NPZ files with `allow_pickle=True` and to use the new generator.

2. `scripts/video_only_facenet_generator.py`: Created a new specialized generator for video-only mode that loads and processes Facenet features correctly.

3. `deploy_fixed_facenet_training.sh`: Created a deployment script to upload the fixed files to the server and launch training.

## How to Deploy and Monitor

1. Run the deployment script to upload the fixed code and start training:
   ```
   ./deploy_fixed_facenet_training.sh
   ```

2. Monitor the training progress using the existing monitoring script:
   ```
   ./monitor_facenet_only_key_fixed.sh
   ```

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the training process should now:

1. Successfully identify and load Facenet feature files
2. Correctly extract emotion labels from filenames
3. Properly train the video-only LSTM model on the Facenet features
4. Save checkpoints to the models directory during training

The monitor script can be used to track training progress and validation accuracy.
