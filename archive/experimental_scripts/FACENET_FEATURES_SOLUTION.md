# Video-Only Facenet LSTM Training Fix

## Problem Identified

The original video-only Facenet LSTM training script (`scripts/train_video_only_facenet_lstm_key_fixed.py`) was failing with the following error:

```
Found 0 Facenet files with valid labels and features.
Skipped 7441 due to label parsing or feature issues.
Train/Val split (Full):
- Train samples: 0
- Validation samples: 0
```

After investigation, we discovered multiple issues:

1. **Feature-Label Mismatch**: The NPZ files contain `video_features` key, but the code was looking for `emotion_label` inside the files, which doesn't exist
2. **Label Generation Issues**: Labels were correctly extracted from filenames but not properly matched with features
3. **Missing Feature Normalization**: Features weren't normalized, potentially causing gradient instability
4. **Data Validation Gaps**: The script wasn't properly validating loaded features
5. **Error Handling Deficiencies**: Errors in file loading weren't gracefully handled

## Root Cause Analysis

Examining sample files (via `debug_facenet_file_keys.py`), we found:

```
Keys: ['video_features' 'timestamps' 'video_path' 'sample_interval']
Video features shape: (57 512)
Video features mean: -0.002996233291924
Video features std: 0.04409249126911163
Video features min: -0.13978567719459534
Video features max: 0.14455924928188324
KeyError: 'emotion_label is not a file in the archive'
```

This showed that the NPZ files:
1. Contain Facenet embeddings under the `video_features` key
2. Do NOT contain embedded labels (no `emotion_label` key)
3. Have properly shaped features (57 timesteps Ã— 512 features)

The original code was:
1. Looking for non-existent keys in files
2. Not properly maintaining correspondence between extracted labels and files
3. Missing a data normalization step
4. Not implementing comprehensive validation of loaded data

## Solution Implemented

We created a comprehensive solution with several components:

### 1. Fixed Video Facenet Generator (`scripts/fixed_video_facenet_generator.py`)

Our new generator:
- Properly extracts and validates features from NPZ files
- Implements feature normalization
- Maintains strict correspondence between files and labels
- Provides detailed error handling and diagnostics
- Automatically calculates feature statistics
- Offers configurable feature normalization
- Implements efficient batch processing

### 2. Fixed Training Script (`scripts/train_video_only_facenet_lstm_fixed.py`) 

The new training script:
- Uses an improved model architecture with layer normalization
- Extracts labels from filenames (not from inside NPZ files)
- Implements proper validation of data files
- Uses feature normalization for better convergence
- Applies class weighting to handle potential imbalance
- Provides comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Implements proper saving of model checkpoints and metrics

### 3. Deployment Script (`deploy_fixed_facenet_training.sh`)

This script enables easy deployment:
- Can run locally or on EC2 instances
- Performs validity checks before deployment
- Creates monitoring tools for remote execution
- Provides detailed feedback during deployment
- Ensures scripts have proper permissions

## Key Improvements

1. **Data Integrity**: The solution maintains strict correspondence between features and labels
2. **Feature Normalization**: Applied feature normalization (mean=0, std=1) for better convergence
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for stability
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimized batch processing and memory usage
5. **Monitoring Capabilities**: Enhanced reporting and metrics collection
6. **Deployment Flexibility**: Can run locally or on EC2 instances 
7. **Architectural Enhancements**: Added layer normalization and improved model structure

## Usage Instructions

To use the fixed implementation:

### Local Execution
```bash
./deploy_fixed_facenet_training.sh --local
```

### EC2 Deployment
```bash
./deploy_fixed_facenet_training.sh
```

The script will prompt for confirmation and provide monitoring capabilities.

## Verification

The fixed implementation has been verified to:
1. Correctly load all valid video feature files
2. Generate appropriate class distributions
3. Maintain feature-label correspondence
4. Begin training with the expected number of samples
5. Show steady improvement in accuracy (beyond random chance)

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify the actual structure of data files before designing data loading pipelines
2. Implement comprehensive validation and error handling
3. Apply feature normalization as a standard practice
4. Maintain strict correspondence between features and labels
5. Use layer normalization for better training stability with sequence data
