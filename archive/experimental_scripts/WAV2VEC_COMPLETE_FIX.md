# WAV2VEC Emotion Recognition Model - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

Our Wav2Vec emotion recognition model had three distinct issues that needed to be addressed:

1. **Syntax Error**: The code had a missing comma in the learning rate scheduler's `set_value` calls, causing a TypeError: 'ResourceVariable' object is not callable.

2. **Data Format Mismatch**: The script was looking for an 'embedding' key in the NPZ files, but the actual key was 'wav2vec_features'.

3. **Variable Sequence Lengths**: The features had variable sequence lengths (different audio durations), causing a ValueError due to inhomogeneous arrays.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Syntax Fix

Fixed the missing commas in the WarmUpReduceLROnPlateau callback:

```python
# Before
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate warmup_lr)
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate new_lr)

# After
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate, warmup_lr)
tf.keras.backend.set_value(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate, new_lr)
```

### 2. Data Key Fix

Updated the data loading function to use the correct keys:

```python
# Before
feature = data['embedding']
label = data['emotion'].item()

# After
feature = data['wav2vec_features']
label = data['emotion'].item() if isinstance(data['emotion'], np.ndarray) else data['emotion']
```

### 3. Sequence Padding Fix

Added a sequence padding mechanism to handle variable-length features:

```python
def pad_sequences(features, max_length=None):
    """Pad sequences to the same length."""
    if max_length is None:
        # Use the 95th percentile length to avoid outliers
        lengths = [len(f) for f in features]
        max_length = int(np.percentile(lengths, 95))
    
    print(f"Padding sequences to length {max_length}")
    
    # Get feature dimension
    feature_dim = features[0].shape[1]
    
    # Initialize output array
    padded_features = np.zeros((len(features), max_length, feature_dim))
    
    # Fill with actual data (truncate if needed)
    for i, feature in enumerate(features):
        seq_length = min(len(feature), max_length)
        padded_features[i, :seq_length, :] = feature[:seq_length]
    
    return padded_features
```

## Performance Improvements

By implementing these fixes, we:

1. Eliminated the TypeError that was preventing training
2. Successfully loaded all the wav2vec features from the dataset
3. Handled variable-length sequences properly with padding
4. Enabled the model to train successfully through multiple epochs

## Further Improvements

The model architecture remained the same, using bidirectional LSTMs for sequence processing:

```python
# Bidirectional LSTM layers
x = Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True))(input_layer)
x = Bidirectional(LSTM(128))(x)

# Dense layers with dropout
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
```

This should provide good performance for emotion recognition from audio features.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

The training progress can be monitored with the provided monitoring script, which shows:
- Emotion distribution in the dataset
- Sequence length statistics
- Padding information
- Training progress (epochs and validation accuracy)

## Conclusion

All three issues have been fixed, and the model is now able to train successfully on the WAV2VEC features for emotion recognition.
