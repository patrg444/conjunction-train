# CNN Feature Extraction Fix for Audio Emotion Recognition

This document summarizes the issue with CNN feature extraction and the implemented solution for both the CREMA-D and RAVDESS datasets.

## Issue Overview

The original feature extraction process was encountering an error with input shape incompatibility:

```
ValueError: Input 0 of layer "cnn_feature_extractor" is incompatible with the layer: 
expected shape=(None, None, 128, 1), found shape=(1, 128, 78)
```

The CNN model expected a 4D input shape `(None, None, 128, 1)` but was receiving a 3D input `(1, 128, X)` where X varies across samples (e.g., 78, 103).

## Root Cause

The spectrograms generated from audio files have inconsistent time dimensions. The CNN model expected each spectrogram to be reshaped into a 4D tensor with a channel dimension, but the original preprocessing code did not properly reshape the input.

## Solution

1. Modified the preprocessing script (`fixed_preprocess_cnn_audio_features.py`) to reshape the input correctly by adding a dimension for channels
2. Ensured compatibility between the input shape and the CNN model's expected shape
3. Implemented error handling to gracefully process or skip problematic files

## Implementation

1. **CREMA-D Dataset**:
   - Created `deploy_fixed_cpu_extraction.sh` script to process CREMA-D spectrograms
   - Used `fixed_preprocess_cnn_audio_features.py` which includes the shape correction
   - Implemented proper error handling and reporting
   - Added monitoring capabilities via progress bar

2. **RAVDESS Dataset**:
   - Created `extract_ravdess_cnn_features.sh` to apply the same fix to RAVDESS data
   - Used the same fixed preprocessing script to ensure consistent feature extraction
   - Created `monitor_ravdess_cnn_extraction.sh` to track extraction progress
   
## Results

- The fixed code successfully processes spectrograms with varying time dimensions
- Features are extracted with proper dimensions expected by downstream models
- CNN feature extraction now runs reliably without shape errors
- Both CREMA-D and RAVDESS datasets can be processed using the same fixed approach

## Usage

1. For CREMA-D dataset:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_fixed_cpu_extraction.sh
   ```

2. For RAVDESS dataset:
   ```bash
   ./extract_ravdess_cnn_features.sh
   ```

3. To monitor extraction progress:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_ravdess_cnn_extraction.sh
   ```

## Recommendations

1. When adding new audio datasets, ensure the spectrograms are processed using the fixed extraction script
2. Monitor extraction carefully when processing a new dataset for the first time
3. If errors occur, check the spectrogram shapes before feeding them to the CNN model
4. Consider adding a dedicated reshaping step in all feature extraction workflows
