# XLM-RoBERTa v2 Model Analysis

## Overview
After examining the XLM-RoBERTa v2 model implementation and setup, I've identified that the technical implementation is sound but the dataset being used locally is insufficient.

## Dataset Issue
The current setup is using extremely small sample datasets:
- `datasets/manifests/humor/train_humor_with_text.csv` (only 8 samples)
- `datasets/manifests/humor/val_humor_with_text.csv` (only 4 samples)

These tiny datasets are unsuitable for training a 559M parameter language model like XLM-RoBERTa-large, which explains why performance might seem disappointing.

## Available Solution
According to the HUMOR_MODELS_README.md, the full system is designed to use the UR-Funny dataset:
- `ur_funny_train_humor_cleaned.csv` - Full training data
- `ur_funny_val_humor_cleaned.csv` - Full validation data

These full datasets are available on the EC2 instance as documented in EC2_DATASET_LOCATIONS.md.

## Technical Implementation Strengths
The implementation includes excellent features:
- Dynamic padding for memory efficiency
- Class weight balancing for imbalanced data
- Cosine learning rate scheduler
- Early stopping with metric monitoring
- Hardware auto-detection

## Recommended Fix
To fix this issue, the `run_xlm_roberta_v2.sh` script should be modified to point to the correct full dataset paths on the EC2 instance instead of the tiny local sample files. This would allow the powerful XLM-RoBERTa model to properly learn from sufficient training data and achieve much better performance.

The specific change needed is to update these paths in the run_xlm_roberta_v2.sh file:
```bash
# Change from
TRAIN_MANIFEST="datasets/manifests/humor/train_humor_with_text.csv"
VAL_MANIFEST="datasets/manifests/humor/val_humor_with_text.csv"

# To
TRAIN_MANIFEST="/path/to/ur_funny_train_humor_cleaned.csv"
VAL_MANIFEST="/path/to/ur_funny_val_humor_cleaned.csv"
```

The exact paths would depend on the EC2 instance file structure, which should be checked with the system administrator or by examining EC2_DATASET_LOCATIONS.md in more detail.
