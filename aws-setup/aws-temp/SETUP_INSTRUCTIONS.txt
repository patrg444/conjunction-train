# AWS Training Setup Instructions

These instructions will help you set up and run your emotion recognition model training on AWS.

## 1. Launch your AWS EC2 Instance

1. Login to the AWS Console with your account ID: 3240-3729-1814
2. Navigate to EC2 and launch a new instance
3. Select a Deep Learning AMI (Amazon Linux 2) with CUDA 11.x
4. Choose one of these instance types:
   - Standard: g4dn.xlarge (~$0.52/hour)
   - High RAM: r5.2xlarge (8 vCPUs, 64GB RAM, ~$0.50/hour) with GPU
   - Maximum performance: p3.8xlarge (4 V100 GPUs, 32 vCPUs, 244GB RAM, ~$12.24/hour)
5. Allocate at least 100GB of storage
6. Configure security groups to allow SSH access
7. Launch the instance and save your key pair if creating a new one

## 2. Upload Files to AWS

From your local machine, upload the files to your EC2 instance:

```bash
# Replace with your key file and instance IP
scp -i your-key.pem * ec2-user@your-instance-ip:~/
```

## 3. Set Up the AWS Environment

SSH into your instance:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip
```

Make the setup script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x aws-instance-setup.sh
./aws-instance-setup.sh
```

## 4. Start Training

Make the training script executable:

```bash
chmod +x train-on-aws.sh
```

Run the training with default parameters (learning rate: 1e-5, 50 epochs):

```bash
./train-on-aws.sh
```

Or customize with options:

```bash
./train-on-aws.sh --learning-rate 2e-5 --epochs 100 --batch-size 64
```

## 5. Monitor and Retrieve Results

Training progress will be displayed in the console and saved to a log file.

After training completes, download the results:

```bash
# From your local machine
scp -i your-key.pem -r ec2-user@your-instance-ip:~/models/branched_6class ./
```

## IMPORTANT: Don't Forget to Stop Your Instance!

When you're done, stop or terminate your instance to avoid unnecessary charges.
