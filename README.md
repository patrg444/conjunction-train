### Why R3D-18?
We keep R3D-18 in the repository as a lightweight, reproducible video baseline. It trains quickly on a single GPU, provides a reasonable reference point for new branches (laughter, smile, text), and plugs cleanly into the fusion head. This makes it ideal for CI forward-pass regression tests and for quantifying gains from the multi-branch architecture.
