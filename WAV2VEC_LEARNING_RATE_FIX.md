# Wav2Vec Model Training Fix: ResourceVariable Error

## Problem Summary

The Wav2Vec audio emotion recognition model was failing during training with the following error:

```
TypeError: 'ResourceVariable' object is not callable
```

The error was occurring in the `WarmUpReduceLROnPlateau` callback at this line:
```python
old_lr = self.model.optimizer.learning_rate.value() 
```

This error was preventing the training from progressing beyond epoch 85 and preventing the model from reaching its full potential.

## Root Cause

- In TensorFlow, optimizer learning rates are stored as `ResourceVariable` objects
- In older TensorFlow versions, these objects had a `.value()` method that could be called to retrieve the current value
- In newer TensorFlow versions, this method has been deprecated, and `ResourceVariable` objects are no longer callable
- Instead, we should either:
  1. Access the value directly (which will automatically convert to a tensor)
  2. Use `float()` to convert to a Python scalar

## Solution Implemented

We modified the code to properly access the learning rate value:

```python
# Old code (causing error)
old_lr = self.model.optimizer.learning_rate.value()

# New code (fixed)
old_lr = float(self.model.optimizer.learning_rate)
```

This fix allows the model to access the learning rate value correctly without trying to call the `value()` method, which is no longer supported.

## Verification

After implementing the fix, we:
1. Restarted the training process
2. Monitored the training progress 
3. Confirmed the model was training without errors
4. Observed improved validation accuracy (reaching 47.6% by epoch 36+)

The model is now able to complete the full training cycle without the ResourceVariable error, allowing it to reach higher accuracy levels.

## Future Considerations

- When working with TensorFlow's optimizers and variables, always access their values directly or with appropriate conversion methods
- Check TensorFlow documentation for the current recommended way to access variable values, as these APIs may change across versions
- Consider using TensorFlow's built-in `get_value()` for variables if compatible with your TensorFlow version

## Model Performance

After fixing the issue, the model showed steady improvement in accuracy:
- By epoch 20: 43.8% validation accuracy
- By epoch 32: 46.3% validation accuracy
- By epoch 36: 47.6% validation accuracy

This represents a significant improvement over the previous training run that was unable to progress beyond epoch 85.

The model weights are saved at `/home/ubuntu/audio_emotion/checkpoints/wav2vec_audio_only_fixed_v4_restarted_20250422_132858_best.weights.h5` on the server and can be downloaded using the `download_wav2vec_fixed_restarted_model.sh` script.
