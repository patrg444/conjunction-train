Deployment successful! Starting extended training with the following details:

- Using best model weights from: /home/ubuntu/audio_emotion/checkpoints/wav2vec_audio_only_fixed_v4_restarted_20250422_132858_best.weights.h5
- Training for additional 100 epochs with batch size of 64
- Learning rate reduced to 0.0005 (from 0.001) for more refined optimization
- Fixed learning rate warm-up implementation working correctly

Current training status:
- Training is running successfully (process ID: 904458)
- Initial validation accuracy (epoch 1): 53.86%
- Improved validation accuracy (epoch 2): 54.32%
- Best validation accuracy so far (epoch 3): 54.55%
- Epochs 4-7 have not improved beyond 54.55%
- Currently on epoch 8 of 100

This is a slight improvement over the previous best accuracy of 54.43%.
The training has 20 epochs of early stopping patience, so it will continue
to try different weight configurations before stopping if no further improvement
is seen.
