# CNN-LSTM Model Fixed Implementation

## Issue Summary
The `train_spectrogram_cnn_pooling_lstm.py` script contained multiple syntax errors where commas were missing between:
- Function parameters
- List elements
- Function call arguments

Specifically:
```python
# Missing commas between function parameters
def __init__(self, learning_rate_base, total_epochs, warmup_epochs=10, min_learning_rate=1e-6) # Fixed
def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None) # Fixed

# Missing commas between array/list elements
LSTM_UNITS = [128, 64] # Fixed
DENSE_UNITS = [256, 128] # Fixed

# Missing commas between function call arguments
cnn_audio_files, all_labels = load_data_paths_and_labels_audio_only(
    RAVDESS_CNN_AUDIO_DIR, CREMA_D_CNN_AUDIO_DIR # Fixed
)
```

## Resolution
1. Added the missing commas throughout the script.
2. Verified that both the data directories exist:
   - `data/ravdess_features_cnn_fixed` 
   - `data/crema_d_features_cnn_fixed`
3. Created a shell script `run_fixed_cnn_lstm.sh` to execute the fixed model.

## Training Process
The model is an audio-only CNN-LSTM that:
1. Uses pre-computed CNN audio features from the fixed directories
2. Processes them through a bidirectional LSTM architecture
3. Applies appropriate regularization (dropout, L2, max norm constraints)
4. Uses a learning rate scheduler with warmup and cosine decay

## Running the Model
You can run the fixed model using:
```bash
./run_fixed_cnn_lstm.sh
```

The script will:
- Ensure the models directory exists
- Run the fixed Python script
- Use the data from the fixed CNN feature directories

## Architecture Details
- Input: Pre-computed CNN audio features
- Processing: Bidirectional LSTM layers (128 → 64 units)
- Classification: Dense layers (256 → 128 → 6 units)
- Regularization: Dropout, L2, Max Norm constraints
- Learning Rate: 0.0005 with warmup and cosine decay
- Batch Size: 24
- Training/Validation Split: 80%/20%
- Classes: 6 emotion categories
