The dimensional ordering matters significantly when using multiple input modalities.
With the wrong order, the model will process audio features as if they were video
features and vice versa, leading to incorrect predictions.

The fixed model ensures that video features (512-d) are processed by the video branch
and audio features (88-d) are processed by the audio branch, maintaining the same
order as during training.
