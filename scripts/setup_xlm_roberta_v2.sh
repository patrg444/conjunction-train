echo "1. Dynamic Padding: 20-30% memory & speed improvement"
echo "2. Class Weight Balancing: Better handling of imbalanced data"
echo "3. Corrected Scheduler Steps: Proper LR scheduling for all setups"
echo "4. Increased Learning Rate: Faster convergence with cosine scheduler"
echo "5. Improved Metric Monitoring: Focus on F1 for better model selection"
echo "6. Enhanced Reproducibility: Deterministic training with fixed seed"
echo "7. Optimized Monitoring: Real-time training progress tracking"
