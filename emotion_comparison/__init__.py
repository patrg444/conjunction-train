Emotion Recognition Feature Extraction Comparison Framework

This package implements four different approaches to feature extraction for emotion recognition:
1. 3D CNN for Spatio-temporal Features
2. Facial Action Coding System (FACS) Features
3. Multi-region Attention Model
4. Pre-trained Emotion-specific Models

Each approach extracts features from video data in the RAVDESS and CREMA-D emotion datasets,
and the results are compared to identify the most effective method.
